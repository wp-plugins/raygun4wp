This plugin allows you to send the PHP errors and exceptions generated by your Wordpress site to Raygun.io. It is quickly and easily configured using its Settings page available from your admin panel.

== Installation  == 

Simple add and enable this plugin, paste in your Raygun API Key (available when you create a new application in your Raygun.io dashboard) and you're done.

== Frequently Asked Questions  ==

= What does my Wordpress site require to use this plugin?  =

This plugin automates the installation of Raygun4php, the PHP 5 provider for Raygun. As a result it requires the dependencies that Raygun4php needs.

Specifically, the server that your Wordpress site runs on requires a **PHP 5.3** environment with the **curl** library and dependencies. Please ask your administrator if this is not enabled (as shown with phpinfo()).

When activating the plugin, if you receive a PHP error message stating that there is an 'Unexpected T_STRING', you may be running a PHP 5.2 or below installation. Raygun4WP currently only supports PHP 5.3, a version compatible with 5.2 may be available - please contact us through raygun.io if you require this.

= How do I use the unique user tracking feature? =

If you enable this feature the currently logged in user's email address will be transmitted along with each message. This will be visible in the Raygun dashboard. If they have associated a Gravatar with that address, you will see their picture. If this feature is not enabled, a random ID will be assigned to each user. Either way, you can view a count of the affected users for each error.
